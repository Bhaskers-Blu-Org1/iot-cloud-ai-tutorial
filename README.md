# IoT, Cloud and AI tutorial

Integration of Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence.

## Scope

This tutorial will teach you how to connect IoT devices to the cloud and develop analytics models to analyse sensor data.
By the end of this tutorial everyone should be able to set up your own IoT hub for handling data from devices, store and process
and have some familiarity with

* Node-RED
* IBM Cloud
* MQTT protocol
* IBM Watson Studio
* Cloundant database
* IBM Watson IoT Platform
* Continuous Delivery
* Cloud Object Storage
* Application Starter Kits
* Cloud Foundry applications
